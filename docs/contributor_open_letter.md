# Open Letter to Developers

"When the river warms in spring, the ducks know first; just when the pufferfish are about to surface!"

Dear friend, I am John, a Java programmer working in an ordinary company. Today, I write this open letter to you who love AI technology and innovation with the most sincere feelings.

Half a year ago, I saw many excellent projects like `Dify`, `Chat2DB`, and other AI-related projects. I thought, how wonderful it would be if I could participate in these projects. Unfortunately, "I have no way to serve my country, having coded for ten years in vain."

I came across Xia Ge's team videos in early 2025, and I was very curious about how they achieved their results. I wanted to replicate their backend service to create a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Unfortunately, what I've created so far is still just an "artificial idiot" - it has low concurrency, no soul, slow response, and many bugs.

Xia Ge's team is our learning model. I really want to have an intelligent backend service like theirs. But I can also understand their decision not to open source. "A single flower does not make spring; a hundred flowers blooming together fill the garden with spring." The era of AI flourishing everywhere might be realized in our generation. We can use our own hands to achieve a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Personally, I believe what they can achieve, we can achieve too - it's just a matter of time. I call this "our journey to obtain the scriptures."

So what difficulties will we encounter on this journey? I think there will be no less than eighty-one challenges. Along this path, various "monsters" will inevitably appear, but there will also be "immortals" secretly helping us, and people joining our journey team.

If you find the above content amusing, then I also feel very fortunate. Being able to make you smile for five seconds out of your 30,000+ days of life can be considered my contribution to you.

Will this idea of a low-cost civilian Jarvis fail? I don't know, but isn't this kind of failure quite common in our ordinary lives?

One thing is certain about the future: someone will completely replicate Xia Ge's team's functionality and achieve a low-cost civilian Jarvis. Will this project be us?

Looking forward to walking this path with you and creating the future together.

# Appendix: Development Contribution Guide
## Project Goals

1. **Low-cost civilian Jarvis solution**  

2. **Intelligent integration solution for surrounding hardware**  

## Join Us

We warmly welcome like-minded friends to join and contribute to the project together. You can view the features we plan to implement soon at [this link](https://github.com/users/xinnan-tech/projects/3). The features in the list that haven't been assigned to anyone yet are urgently in need of your participation. Participation methods are as follows:

### 1. Become a Regular Contributor

Fork the project, submit PRs, which will be reviewed by developers and merged into the main branch.

### 2. Become a Developer

When you have accumulated 3 valid PR submissions, you can contact the group owner to apply to become a developer. The group owner will invite you to join an independent developer group to discuss the project's future together.

## Developer Workflow

1. **Create a new branch**  
   Develop each feature point using a new branch. Branch names should be concise and clear, allowing people to immediately understand the implemented functionality and avoid feature conflicts.

2. **Submit PR for review**  
   After feature development is completed, please submit a PR on GitHub for review by other developers. After approval, it will be merged into the main branch.
